The principal Central Acts, namely the Opium Act, 1857, the Opium Act, 1878 and the Dangerous Drugs Act,1930 were enacted a long time ago. With the passage of time and the developments in the field of illicit drug traffic and drug abuse at national and international level, many deficiencies in the existing laws have come to notice, some of which are indicated below:<P/>(i) The scheme of penalties under the present Acts is not sufficiently deterrent to meet the challenge of well-organized gangs of smugglers. The Dangerous drugs Act, 1930, provides for a miximum term of imprisonment of 3 years with or without fine and 4 years imrpisonment with or without fine for repeated offences. Further, no minimum punishment is prescribed in the present laws, as a result of which drug traffickers have been some time let off by the courts with nominal punishment. The country has for the last few years been increasingly facing the problem of transit traffic of drugs coming mainly from some of our neighbouring countries and destined mainly to Western countries.<P/>(ii) The existing Central laws do not provide for investing the officers of a number of important Central enforcemnt agencies like narcotics customs, Central excise, etc., with the power of investigation of offences under the said laws.<P/>(iii) Since the enactment of the aforesaid three Central Acts a vast body of international law in the field of narcotics control has evolved through various international treaties and protocols. The Government of India has been a party to these treaties and conventions which entail several obligations which are not covered or are only partly convered by the present Acts.<P/>(iv) During recent years new drugs of addiction which have come to be known as psychotropicsubstances have appeared on the scene and posed serious problems to national Governments. There is no comprehensice law to enable exercise of control over psychotropic substances in India in the manner as envisaged in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 to which also India has acceded.<P/><P/>2. In view of what has been stated above, there is an urgent need for the enactment of a comprehensive legislation on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which, inter alia, should consolidate and amend the existing laws relating to narcotic drugs, strengthen the existing controls over drugs of abuse, considerably enhance the penalties particularly for trafficking offences, make provisions for exercising effective control over psychotropic substances and make provisions for the implementation of international conventions relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances to which India has become a party.<P/><P/>3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.</StatementofObject><Chapters><Chapter><Number>CHAPTER I</Number><Name>PRELIMINARY</Name><Sections><Section><Number>1</Number><Heading>Short title, extent and commencement</Heading>(1) This Act maybe called the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.<NewPara/>(2) It extends to the whole of India.<NewPara/>(3) It shall come into force on such date [Fn. 1] as the central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint, and different dates may be appointed for different provisions of this Act and for different States and any reference in any such provision to the commencement of this Act shall be construed in relation to any state as a reference to the coming into force of that provision in that State.<NewPara/>FOOTNOTES :<NewPara/>1.
