                            The Secretary of Defence, Mr January Masilela gave an overview of the 2007/08 -2009/10 
                            Strategic Plan as well as the 2007/2008 Budget as incorporated in the 2007-2010

						<p>
                            The Department’s 2007/08 -2009/10 Strategic Plan is aligned with key government priorities 
                            which includes: the consolidation of the African Agenda; halving unemployment and poverty by 2014; 
                            national human resource development as well as fighting crime and corruption.
                        </p>
						<p>
                            Through specific cluster and programme interventions the Department would address 
                            the following key departmental strategic objectives: the creation of national and 
                            continental stability through increasing peace mission deployments; 
                            skills development through the Military Skills Development System [MSDS] 
                            and training to military personnel exiting the military; assistance to the South 
                            African police services in emergency cases and the development of scarce skills.
                        </p>
						<p>
                            The annual budget for the current MTEF period reflects a growth from R20.5 billion 
                            in 2003/2004; to R25.9 billion in 2007/2008 and to R28.9 billion for 2009/2010 
                            financial years.
                        </p>
						<p>
                            An additional R1.2 billion has been allocated to the department for the current financial 
                            year. The reasons for such additional funding were cited as follows:
                        </p>

							<p>
                                The Strategic Business Plan identified the need for IT-based internal control 
                                systems for finance, human resources and procurement, as well as a time frame 
                                for the implementation of the integrated finance management system.  
                                To date, IT systems have been slightly enhanced in line with the moratorium 
                                placed by the National Treasury on the replacement of the current system. 
                                The alignment would be addressed through projects such as Loquacious, 
                                Lekgadima and Balance Scorecard.
                            </p>
							<p>
                                A doubling of annual increases for this programme over the current MTEF 
                                cycle was reported, due to the devolution of funding from the Department 
                                of Public Works. 
                            </p>
							<p>
                                R1.93billion had been allocated for the 2007/2008 financial year and 
                                represented a 9.9 percent budgetary increase. 
                            </p>
							<p>
                                Allocations to sub programmes such as property management and departmental 
                                direction have increased by 12.3 and 27.8 percent respectively. 
                                This was mainly due to the relocation of the 
                                National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC) inspectorate. 
                                An increased international representation accounted for the increased 
                                allocation to Defence Foreign Relations (DFR) 
                            </p>

							<p>
                                While annual allocations to this programme would increase by 6.1 percent over the next three 
                                financial years, R4,21billion had been allocated for the current financial year. 
                                The total annual budget for the general training has increased by 41.6 percent to expand 
                                conventional reserves training and the intake into the Military Skills Development Strategy (MSDS).
                                Since new generation art equipment had been commissioned, 
                                Artillery and Air Defence reflected a 12.6 and 11.4 percent increase in allocations respectively.  
                            </p>
							<p>
                                These budget allocations will be utilised to fund the interventions for the improvement of 
                                the rejuvenation of the MSDS, and the efficiency of the Military Exit Mechanism [MEM], 
                                as discussed in the Strategic Business Plan. Additional risks were also identified which 
                                included: the continued deterioration of facilities; the impact of insufficient funding and 
                                health of members of the SANDF and combat readiness,

                                Through a joint initiative with the Department of Defence, the policy to support 
                                the local defence related industry will be reviewed; a Defence industry sector 
                                strategy will also be developed. Increased investment in the retention and maintenance 
                                of strategic industrial technology will characterise the 2007 – 2010 MTEF cycle.

							<p>
                                A growth of 21.1 percent in the funding of the procurement services sub 
                                programmes over the next three years was reported. This was mainly due to 
                                the imperatives of the strategic airlift capability, which will grow by 25.1 
                                percent.
